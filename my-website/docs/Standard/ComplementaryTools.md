# Complementary tools

## Communication

<div>
    For communication we decided to use the **Discord** tool where we set up a communication room in order to exchange between members.

## Organization

<div>
    As for the organization we decided to use **Trello**. You will find the progress of the project there and you can choose the feature you wish to develop. After meeting with the team, you can add new functionality to improve the project or add tickets for any bug:
