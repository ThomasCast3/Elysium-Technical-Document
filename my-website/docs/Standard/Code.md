# Code

## Naming conventions

<div>
    In the project we decided to use camelcase for folder names, file names and variables. Except that folders will start with an uppercase letter while files and variables with a lowercase one.
</div>

## Github

<div>
    The Github part is divided into two parts: new features and merge requests.
    </div>

### new features

<div>
    For each new feature the developer will have to create a branch with the naming convention: feature/name_of_the_feature/specificity.  
    Only one person at a time per branch to avoid merge problems.
</div>

### merge requests

<div>
    Once the features are finished, the developer, after having all push on his branch, must make a merge request which another developer must accept after reviewing the code to ensure that there are no problems.
</div>
