# Standard

<div class="row-element">
  <div class="element-margin-left">
    We decided, as a team, to put in place standards in order to facilitate teamwork and to maintain consistency throughout the project.  
        - Firstly we have the "[**Code standards**](Standard/Code.md)", where you will find the naming conventions and project management with github.
        - Secondly, you will find complementary "[**Tools**](Standard/ComplementaryTools.md)" for the projects, whether for communication or organization.
